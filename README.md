MindfulList is a web application developed to provide low cost mental health options to users.
Using the Meetup API, we were able to use an AJAX call to show resources onto our page depending on 
a users location (between NYC, Philly and San Fransisco) 
and mental illness (between Anxiety, Depression, Addictions, & DID).

Alongside meetups, we wanted to provide videos & articles.
